# VnV(Vision & Visualization)

There is no day or night for us who combine computer vision research with beautiful visualization.

V&V (a.k.a Vision and Visualization) is a group that conducts research on Computer Vision Engineer and Data Visualization Developer, which consists of a few elite groups.

Our future sees light. I hope that light becomes a beautiful light like a rainbow.
